\label{sec:interpolation}

We now present a formal definition of the notion of interpolation:

\begin{defi}
	\label{def:interpolant}
	Let $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ be sets of first-order formulas.
	An \defiemph{interpolant} of $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ is a first-order formula $I$ such that 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $ \Gamma \entails I$ \label{int_1}
		\item $ I \entails \Delta $  \label{int_2}
		\item $ \Lang(I) \subseteq \Lang(\Gamma) \intersect \Lang(\Delta)$.  \label{int_3}
	\end{enumerate}

	\begin{samepage}
		A \defiemph{reverse interpolant} of $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ is a first-order formula $I$ such that $I$ meets conditions \ref{int_1} and \ref{int_3} of an interpolant as well as:
		\begin{enumerate}
				\renewcommand{\theenumi}{\arabic{enumi}'}
				\setcounter{enumi}{1}
			\item $ \Delta \entails \lnot I $  \label{int_2prime}
				\qedhere
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{samepage}
\end{defi}

%\begin{thm}[Interpolation]
\begin{restatable}[Interpolation]{thm}{interpolationThm}
	\label{thm:interpolation_original}
	Let $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ be sets of first-order formulas such that $ \Gamma \entails \Delta $.
	Then there exists an interpolant for $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$.
%\end{thm}
\end{restatable}
%
%\begin{thm}[Reverse Interpolation]
\begin{restatable}[Reverse Interpolation]{thm}{interpolationRevThm}
		\label{thm:interpolation}
		Let $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ be sets of first-order formulas such that $ \Gamma \cup \Delta $ is unsatisfiable.
		Then there exists a reverse interpolant for $\Gamma$ and\nolinebreak{} $\Delta$.
\end{restatable}



\begin{prop}
	Theorem \ref{thm:interpolation_original} and \ref{thm:interpolation} are equivalent.
	\label{prop:interpolations_equivalent}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ be sets of first-order formulas such that $ \Gamma \entails \Delta$.
	Then $\Gamma \cup \lnot \Delta$ is unsatisfiable.
	By Theorem \ref{thm:interpolation}, there exists a reverse interpolant $I$ for $\Gamma$ and $\lnot \Delta$.
	As $\lnot \Delta \entails \lnot I$, we get by contraposition that $I \entails \Delta$, hence $I$ is an interpolant for $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$.

	For the other direction,
	let $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ be sets of first-order formulas such that $ \Gamma \cup \Delta$ is unsatisfiable.
	Then $\Gamma \entails \lnot \Delta$, hence by Theorem \ref{thm:interpolation_original}, there exists an interpolant $I$ of $\Gamma$ and $\lnot \Delta$.
	But as thus $ I\entails \lnot \Delta$, we get by contraposition that $\Delta \entails \lnot I$, so $I$ is a reverse interpolant for $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$.
\end{proof}

As the notions of interpolation and reverse interpolation in this sense coincide, we will in the following only speak of interpolation where it will be clear from the context which definition applies.

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:logically_equivalent_sets}
	Let $\Gamma, \Gamma', \Delta, \Delta'$ be sets of first-order formulas such that $\Gamma \semiff \Gamma'$ and $\Delta \semiff \Delta'$ and $\Lang(\Gamma) \cap \Lang(\Delta) = \Lang(\Gamma') \cap \Lang(\Delta')$.
	Then $I$ is an interpolant for $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ if and only if $I$ is an interpolant for $\Gamma'$ and $\Delta'$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Clearly $\Gamma \entails I$ holds if and only if $\Gamma' \entails I$ and similarly
	$\Delta \entails \lnot I$ holds if and only if $\Delta' \entails \lnot I$.
	As the intersections of the respective languages coincide, the language condition on $I$ is satisfied in both directions.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
	In Lemma \ref{lemma:logically_equivalent_sets}, it is not sufficient to require that $\Gamma \semiff \Gamma'$ and $\Delta \semiff \Delta'$. 
	Consider the example where
	$\Gamma = \{ \forall x (x=c)\}$ and $\Delta = \lnot \Gamma$
	as well as  
	$\Gamma' = \{ \forall x (x=d)\}$ and $\Delta' = \lnot \Gamma'$.
	Then even though $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ as well as $\Delta$ and $\Delta'$ have the same models,
	$\Lang(\Gamma) \cap \Lang(\Delta) = \{c\}$
	whereas
	$\Lang(\Gamma') \cap \Lang(\Delta') = \{d\}$.
	Therefore $\forall x (x=c)$ is an interpolant for $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ but not for $\Gamma'$ and $\Delta'$.
\end{remark}



In the context of interpolation, every non-logical symbol is assigned a color which indicates its origin(s). 
\begin{defi}[Coloring]
	\label{def:coloring}
A non-logical symbol is said to be \defiemph{$\Gamma$ ($\Delta$)-colored} if it only occurs in $\Gamma$ ($\Delta$) and \defiemph{grey} in case it occurs in both $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$. A symbol is \defiemph{colored} if it is $\Gamma$- or $\Delta$-colored.
A term is \defiemph{$\Phi$-colored} for $\Phi \in \{\Gamma, \Delta\}$ if its outermost symbol is $\Phi$-colored.
We also refer to $\Phi$-colored terms simply as \defiemph{$\Phi$-terms}.

%A term $t$ is \defiemph{single-colored} if $t$ is $\Phi$-colored for some $\Phi$ and all colored symbols in $t$ are $\Phi$-colored.
%A term $t$ is \defiemph{multi-colored} if $t$ is $\Phi$-colored for some $\Phi$ and $t$ contains a term which is colored but not $\Phi$-colored.
%Note that a multi-colored $\Phi$-term consequently is a term whose outermost symbol is $\Phi$-colored and contains a colored but not $\Phi$-colored subterm.
An occurrence of a $\Phi$-term is called \emph{maximal} if it does not occur as subterm of another $\Phi$-term.
An occurrence of a colored term $t$ is \emph{maximal colored} if it does not occur as subterm of another colored term.
%  An occurrence of a term $t$ is called \defiemph{$\Phi$-colored} if $t$ is contained in a maximal $\Phi$-colored term.
%	$t$ is called \defiemph{colored} if $t$ is of any color and \defiemph{grey} otherwise.
\end{defi}

We sometimes use $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ as colors to emphasise that the reasoning at hand is valid irrespective of the actual color assignment and solely assuming that $\Phi \neq \Psi$. 

\begin{exa}
	Let
	$\Gamma = \{ P(f(a)) \limpl Q(h(x)), R(h(a), b) \} $
	and 
	$\Delta = \{ R(h(b), x) \}$.
	Then the predicate symbols $P$ and $Q$ are $\Gamma$-colored and $R$ is grey.
	The function symbol $f$ is $\Gamma$-colored whereas $h$ is grey.
	Among the constant symbols, $a$ is $\Gamma$-colored and $b$ is grey.

	Note that in $\Gamma$, $a$ occurs twice:
	In $R(h(a), b)$, it occurs as a maximal colored term since it does not occur as subterm of a larger colored term.
	It is also a maximal $\Gamma$-term as it is not contained in a $\Gamma$-term.
	In $P(f(a))$ on the other hand, it does occur in a $\Gamma$-term and hence is neither a maximal colored nor a maximal $\Gamma$-colored occurrence.

	Now consider the term $g(a)$.
	Here, $a$ occurs as subterm of a colored term and therefore it is not a maximal colored occurrence.
	It is however a maximal $\Gamma$-colored occurrence, as it is not contained in a $\Gamma$-term. 
	By the definition of the coloring, terms containing symbols of different colors are not contained in $\Gamma$ or $\Delta$.
\end{exa}


\subsection{Degenerate cases}
In this thesis, the equality symbol as well as the symbols for truth and falsity are regarded as a logical symbol. 
This is justified by the following examples, which are referred to in \cite[Example 20.2 and 20.4]{boolos2007computability} as ``failure of interpolation'' and ``degenerate cases'' respectively:

\begin{exa}
	\label{exa:degenerate_equality}
	Let $\Gamma = \{ a=b \} $ and $\Delta = \{P(a), \lnot P(b)\}$.
	Note that here, the intersection of $\Lang(\Gamma)$ and $\Lang(\Delta)$ does not contain a predicate symbol.
	By regarding $=$ as logical symbol and therefore permitting it to occur in an interpolant despite the fact that it does not occur in $\Delta$ allows for the interpolant $a=b$.
	If we would not permit $=$ in the interpolant, there would be no interpolant for $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$, even though $\Gamma \cup \Delta$ clearly is unsatisfiable.

	Similarily, for the pair $\Gamma' = \{ P(a) \land \lnot P(b) \}$ and $\Delta' = \{a\neq b\}$, the equality symbol must occur in the interpolant. In this instance, the occurrence must be negative.
\end{exa}

\begin{exa}
	Let $\Gamma = \{ P(a) \land \lnot P(a) \} $ and $\Delta = \emptyset$.
	As clearly the intersection of $\Lang(\Gamma)$ and $\Lang(\Delta)$ is empty, we may form an interpolant only of logical symbols.
	In this instance, the interpolant must be either $\bot$ or a formula logically equivalent to $\bot$.
	By merely swapping $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$, we arrive at a situation where the interpolant must be equivalent to $\top$.

	Note that as we can express formulas, which are logically equivalent to $\bot$ and $\top$ respectively by employing the equality symbol\footnote{$\forall x\,x\neq x$ and $\forall x\,x=x$ are suitable examples for $\bot$ and $\top$ respectively.}, the symbols for truth and falsity are not strictly required to be regarded as logical symbols for the interpolation theorem to hold.
\end{exa}
