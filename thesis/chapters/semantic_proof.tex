	\item{$T[\Gamma]$:}

$\Gamma$ is a set of formulas in the theory $T$

$T[\Gamma]$: theory obtained from $T$ with $\Gamma$ as additional (nonlogical) axioms


	\item{Extension of theory:}
		may contains additional symbols and new theorems, and every symbol/theorem of the old language/theory is a symbol/theorem of the new language/theory

		elementary: from wikipedia: if all formulas of the language of the larger one with variables interpreted with elements of the smaller language hold in the smaller iff they hold in the larger.

	\item{Conservative extension of theory:}
		$T'$ is conservative extension of $T$ if formulas in $T$ which are theorems of $T'$ are theorems in $T$.

		Hence additional formulas may only be theorems if they involve new symbols.

	\item{Reduction theorem for consistency:}
		if a set of formulas in a theory is inconsistent, then there is a disjunction of negated formulas of the set which is a theorem of $T$

	\item{Chain:}
		a sequence of structure, such that every one is an extension of the former

		a chain is elementary if every element is an elementary extension of the former

	\item{Tarksi's Lemma:}
		the union of an elementary chain is an elementary extension of each member

	\item{Regular set of formulas:} 
		every $x=y$ or $x\neq y$ is contained, and for every formula $A[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ is contained (does not say if $x_i$ is var or term)
