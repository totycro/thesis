\chapter{Interpolant extraction from resolution proofs in one phase}
\label{sec:one_phase}
\label{chap:one_phase}

In contrast to the approach described in chapter \ref{sec:two_phases}, where propositional interpolants are extracted first and colored terms lifted just in a second, separate phase, 
we now present a method which is based on the former but merges the two phases.

The motivation for the separation in two phases lies in the fact that only after the formation of the propositional interpolant, all terms and their logical relation can be known.
This however neglects the fact that proofs are frequently structured in a way such that the occurrence of certain symbols and variables are restricted to certain areas of the proof.
By lifting these and prefixing the entire interpolant with their respective quantifier, the resulting formula is not optimal in the sense that the quantifier scope can be minimized.

Consider the following example:

\begin{exa}
	\label{exa:one_phase_motivation}
	Let $\Gamma = \{ P(x) \lor Q(y) \}$ and $\Delta = \{\lnot P(a), \lnot Q(a)\}$.
	We consider the following refutation of $\Gamma \cup \Delta$, which we annotate by the interpolation extraction by appending $\PI(C)$ to each clause $C$, separated by ``$|$''.
	For the sake of brevity, we sometimes give simplified but logically equivalent versions of $\PI(C)$.
	This notational convention will be used throughout this thesis for examples of a similar form.

	\begin{prooftree}
		\AxiomCm{ P(x) \lor Q(y) \mid \bot}
		\AxiomCm{ \lnot P(a)  \mid \top}
		\BinaryInfCm{ Q(y) \mid P(a) }
		\AxiomCm{ \lnot Q(a)  \mid \top}
		\BinaryInfCm{ \square \mid Q(a) \lor P(a) }
	\end{prooftree}

	Lifting and quantification of this propositional interpolant according to Theorem~\ref{thm:two_phases} gives the interpolant $\forall x_a (Q(x_a) \lor P(x_a))$.
	Note however that the stronger formula $(\forall x_a Q(x_a) ) \lor (\forall x_a P(x_a))$ is an interpolant as well, but can not be constructed by this method.
	Consider yet that $\Delta$ entails the negated interpolant, so by generalizing the interpolant, the formula entailed by $\Delta$ becomes more specialized.
\end{exa}

%Colored terms satisfying certain restrictions which allow for determining the order of the quantifier of the their corresponding lifting variables are lifted and bound during the extractions of the interpolants.
%The resulting interpolants are therefore in general not in prenex form.

%The key idea which enables this early lifting of colored terms is that proofs often consist of several parts which are independent of each other. 


\section{Interpolant extraction with simultaneous lifting}

We now define the incrementally lifted interpolant $\LI$.
Note that the structure of the resulting formula coincides with the ones from $\PI$ as defined in Definition~\ref{def:PI} except for quantifiers and, of course, the colored terms.

\begin{defi}[Incrementally lifted interpolant $\LI$]
	Let $\pi$ be a resolution refutation of $\Gamma \cup \Delta$.
	We define $\LI(\pi)$ to be $\LI(\square)$, where $\square$ is the empty clause derived in $\pi$.

	Let $C$ be a clause in $\pi$. 
	%For a literal $\lambda$ in $C$, we denote the corresponding literal in $\LIcl(C)$ by $\lambda\cll$, whose existence is ensured Lemma~\ref{lemma:li_vs_clause_plus_literals_equal}.
	We define the intermediary formula $\LIpre(C)$ as follows:
	\begin{description}
		\item{} Base case.
			If $C \in \Gamma\cup \Delta$, $\LIpre(C) \defeq \PIinit(C)$.

		\item{} Induction step.
			If $C$ is the result of an inference $\inference$ using the clauses $\bar C$, then $\LIpre(C) \defeq \PIstep(\inference, \LI(C_1), \dots, \LI(C_n))$.

	\end{description}

	\noindent
	$\LI(C)$ is built from $\LIpre(C)$ according to the following lifting procedure:

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Lift all maximal colored occurrences of a term $t$ in $\LIpre(C)$ for which at least one of the following conditions, referred to as \defiemph{lifting conditions}, applies:
			\begin{itemize} 
				\item The term $t$ contains some variable $x$ such that $x$ does not occur in\nolinebreak{} $C$.
				\item The term $t$ is ground and $C$ does not contain $t$.
			\end{itemize} 
			Denote the resulting formula by $\lifpart(\LIpre(C))$.

		\item 
Let $\lifpart^*(\LIpre(C))$ be 
$\lifpart(\LIpre(C))$  where every lifting variable $z_t$, which occurs free, is substituted by a fresh lifting variable $z'_{t}$.\footnote{See Example~\ref{exa:lemma_part_renaming} for an illustration.} 
\label{lemma_part_renaming}

		\item Let $X$ ($Y$) be the set of $\Delta$-($\Gamma$-)lifting variables which occur free in  
			$\lifpart^*(\LIpre(C))$.
			Form an arrangement $\Q(C)$ of the elements of $\{\forall x_t \mid x_t \in X\}\cup\allowbreak\{\exists y_t \mid y_t \in Y\}$ such that if $s$ and $r$ are terms such that $s$ is a subterm of $r$, then $z_s$ precedes\nolinebreak{} $z_r$.
			Finally, let $\LI(C) \defeq Q(C) \lifpart^*(\LIpre(C))$.
			\qedhere
	\end{enumerate}
\end{defi}

%\section{Properties of $\LI$ and $\LIcl$}



%\begin{remark}
%	As a local optimisation, the quantifiers can be moved inwards such that they exhibit the smallest scope which covers every occurrence of the bound variable.
%	Note that when doing so, non-maximal occurrences of these terms have to be taken as being lifted 
%\end{remark}


\section{Main lemma}
Note that the lifting conditions ensure that only terms are lifted,
which do not exhibit a direct logical relation with any term in the remaining clause.
More precisely, they do not influence the subsequent resolution derivation: 
If a variable $x$ occurs in $\LI(C)$ but not in $C$, then as all clauses in a resolution refutation are pairwise variable-disjoint, the variable $x$ does not occur in any other clause.
For ground terms $r$ however which occur in $\LI(C)$ but not in $C$,
it is possible for them to cooccur in a subsequent clause. Let $p$ be the occurrence of $r$ in $\LI(C)$ and $q$ the occurrence of $r$ in a successor-clause of $C$.
Then due to the fact that $p$ is not used in any unification, 
$q$ must be created or originate from other occurrences of the same function and/or constant symbols.
Note that the lifting conditions ensure that for these, the order of the quantifiers of their respective lifting variables is established in a fashion appropriate for ensuring the logical validity of the interpolant, but despite the syntactic equality between $p$ and $q$, there is no logical relation between them.

We now show more formally that the lifting conditions ensure that if a term contains another term, the subterm is not lifted before the superterm:


\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:lifting_conditions}
	Let $C$ be a clause in a resolution refutation of $\Gamma \cup \Delta$.
	Then if a term $t$ occurs in $\LIpre(C)$ or $\LI(C)$, no subterm $s$ of $t$ is lifted in $\LIpre(C)$ or $\LI(C)$ respectively.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We proceed by induction on the resolution refutation.

	For the base case, consider that if $C \in \Gamma \cup \Delta$, then $\LIpre(C)$ is either $\bot$ or $\top$ and consequently also $\LI(C)$.

	Now suppose that the lemma holds for the clauses $C_1, \dots, C_n$ which are used in an inference $\inference$ to derive the clause $C$ using the unifier $\sigma = \mgu(\inference)$.
	Then if $t$ is a term in $\LIpre(C)$, no subterm $s$ of $t$ is lifted since either $t$ is present in $\LI(C_i) \lor C_i$ for some $i$, $1\varleq i \varleq n$, where the induction hypothesis applies,
	or otherwise $t$ is introduced by means of $\sigma$. But as $\sigma$ is calculated only from the resolution inference, no lifting terms can occur in $\ran(\sigma)$.

	Now let $t$ be a term in $\LI(C)$ which is not lifted. Let $s$ be a subterm of $t$ and for the sake of contradiction, suppose that $s$ is lifted in $\LI(C)$.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Suppose that $s$ is lifted due to containing a variable which does not occur in\nolinebreak{} $C$.
			Then as $s$ is a subterm of $t$, $t$ contains this variable as well and therefore is lifted in $\LI(C)$, contradicting the assumption.

		\item Suppose that $s$ is lifted due to being a ground term which does not occur in\nolinebreak{} $C$.
			Then $t$ does not occur in $C$ either as any occurrence of $t$ contains~$s$. 
			Hence $t$ is lifted in $\LI(C)$, contradicting the assumption.
			\qedhere
	\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:lipre_implies_li}
	Let $C$ be a clause in a resolution refutation of $\Gamma \cup \Delta$.
	Then
	$\Gamma \entails \lifdeltanovar{ \LIpre(C) } \lor \lifdeltanovar{C_\Gamma}$
	implies 
	$\Gamma \entails \lifdeltanovar{ \LI(C) } \lor \lifdeltanovar{C_\Gamma}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Let $t_1, \dots, t_n$ be the maximal colored terms in $\LIpre(C)$ for which some lifting conditions applies in ascending subterm order. The set $\{t_{n-i+1}, \dots, t_n \}$  for $0\varleq i \varleq n$ is designated by $T_i$.
	We denote by $\lifpart^*(\LIpre(C), T_i)$ the result of lifting all terms of $T_i$ and replacing the lifting variables by fresh ones analogous to step~\ref{lemma_part_renaming} of the lifting procedure of $\LI$.
	The fresh lifting variables are highlighted by a prime.
	We use $Q_i z'_{t_i}$ to denote either $\exists y'_{t_i}$ in case $t_i$ is $\Gamma$-colored or $\forall x'_{t_i}$ in case $t_i$ is $\Delta$-colored.

	We show the result by an induction over \[\Gamma \entails \lifdeltanovar{ Q_{n-i+1} z'_{t_{n-i+1}} \dots Q_n z'_{t_n} \lifpart^*( \LIpre(C), T_i )} \lor \lifdeltanovar{C_\Gamma}\] for $ 0 \varleq i\varleq n$.

	Note that for $i=0$, 
	$\Gamma \entails \lifdeltanovar{ Q_{n-i+1} z'_{t_{n-i+1}} \dots Q_n z'_{t_n} \lifpart^*( \LIpre(C), T_i )} \lor \lifdeltanovar{C_\Gamma}$ is nothing else than $\Gamma \entails \lifdeltanovar{\LIpre(C)} \lor \lifdeltanovar{C_\Gamma}$, which holds by assumption.

	%For the induction step, 
	Now suppose that $\Gamma \entails \lifdeltanovar{ Q_{n-i+1} z'_{t_{n-i+1}} \dots Q_n z'_{t_n} \lifpart^*( \LIpre(C), T_i )} \lor \lifdeltanovar{C_\Gamma}$ holds for some $i$ such that $0\varleq i < n$.
	In $\lifpart^*( \LIpre(C), T_{i+1} )$, the term $t_{n-i}$ is lifted.
	We distinguish based on the color of $t_{n-i}$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
			Suppose that $t_{n-i}$ is a $\Delta$-term.
			Then the lifting variable $x'_{t_{n-i}}$ occurs free in $\lifdeltanovar{ Q_{n-i+1} z'_{t_{n-i+1}} \dots Q_n z'_{t_n} \lifpart^*( \LIpre(C), T_i )}$.
			Note that it is possible that an occurrence of the term $t_{n-i}$ is lifted and quantified in $\LI(C')$ for some predecessor $C'$ of $C$ and the occurrence of $t_{n-i}$ in $\LIpre(C)$ may be in the scope of that quantifier\footnote{See Example~\ref{exa:lemma_part_renaming} for an illustration.}. 
			However as the lifting variable replacing the occurrence of $t_{n-i}$ in $\LIpre(C)$ is renamed to the fresh variable $z'_{t_{n-i}}$, it is not bound by any quantifier present in $\LIpre(C)$.
			%However $x_{t_{i+1}}$ is prevented from being bound by that quantifier due 
			%$x_{t_{i+1}}$ is not bound by quantifiers binding other occurrences of this lifting variable due to the renaming 


			As some lifting condition holds for $t_{n-i}$, $C$ does not contain $t_{n-i}$ and hence
			$\lifdeltanovar{C_\Gamma}$ does not contain $x'_{t_{n-i}}$. Therefore $\lifdeltanovar{C_\Gamma}$ does not need to be included in the scope of the quantification of $x'_{t_{n-i}}$.

			Note that we must ensure that we quantify $x'_{t_{n-i}}$ such that every existential quantifier, whose witness term contains $x'_{t_{n-i}}$, is in the scope of the quantification of $x'_{t_{n-i}}$. 
			The terms in question are maximal colored $\Gamma$-colored superterms of $t$.

			By the contraposition of Lemma~\ref{lemma:lifting_conditions}, since $t_{n-i}$ is lifted, every maximal colored superterm $s$ of $t_{n-i}$ must be lifted and quantified either in $\LIpre(C)$, or some lifting condition must apply for $s$ in $\LIpre(C)$.
			In the latter case, $s$ is contained in $\{t_{n-i+1},\dots, t_n\}$.
			In any case, the quantifier for the lifting variable replacing $s$ is contained in $\lifdeltanovar{ Q_{n-i+1} z'_{t_{n-i+1}} \dots Q_n z'_{t_n} \lifpart^* ( \LIpre(C), T_i )}$.                                 

			%Note that the $\Gamma$-colored superterms $s$ of $t$ are the only ones where the lifting variable replacing $t_{n-i}$ occurs in the witness term. 
			%Hence we must ensure that the lifting variable replacing $t_{n-i}$ is quantified such that the quantification of the lifting variable replacing $s$ is in its scope.

			Hence we may quantify $x'_{t_{n-i}}$ universally as follows:
			\[\Gamma \entails \lifdeltanovar{ \forall x'_{t_{n-i}} Q_{n-i+1} z'_{t_{n-i+1}} \dots Q_n x'_{t_{n}} \lifpart^*( \LIpre(C), T_{i+1} )} \lor \lifdeltanovar{C_\Gamma}.\]
			%This however is nothing else than 
			%$\Gamma \entails \lifdeltanovar{ Q_1 z_{t_1} \dots Q_{i+1} z_{t_{i+1}} \lifpart^*( \LIpre(C), T_{i+1} )} \lor \lifdeltanovar{C_\Gamma}$.

		\item
			Otherwise $t_{n-i}$ is a $\Gamma$-term.
			By Lemma~\ref{lemma:lifting_conditions}, no subterm of $t_{n-i}$ is lifted and quantified in $\LIpre(C)$.
			Moreover, all subterms of $t_{n-i}$ which satisfy some lifting condition are contained in $\{t_{1}, \dots, t_{n-i-1}\}$
			and hence not lifted in
			$\lifdeltanovar{ Q_{n-i+1} z'_{t_{n-i+1}} \dots Q_n z'_{t_n} \lifpart^*( \LIpre(C), T_i )}$.
			Therefore $\lifdelta{t_{n-i}}$ is a valid witness term for the existential quantification of $y'_{t_{n-i}}$ in
			\[\Gamma \entails \lifdeltanovar{ \exists y'_{t_{n-i}} Q_{n-i+1} z'_{t_{n-i+1}} \dots Q_n z'_{t_n}  \lifpart^*( \LIpre(C), T_{i+1} )} \lor \lifdeltanovar{C_\Gamma}.\]


			%$\lifdeltanovar{t_{n-i}}$ occurs in 
			%$\lifdeltanovar{ Q_{n-i+1} z'_{t_{n-i+1}} \dots Q_n z'_{t_n} \lifpart^*( \LIpre(C), T_i )}$.
			%Hence all $\Delta$-lifting variables in $\lifdeltanovar{t_{n-i}}$ either occur free 
			%or replace terms contained in $\{t_{1}, \dots, t_i\}$ due to satisfying some lifting condition.
			%However in
			%\[\Gamma \entails \lifdeltanovar{ Q_1 z'_{t_1} \dots Q_i z'_{t_i} \exists y'_{t_{i+1}} \lifpart^*( \LIpre(C), T_{i+1} )} \lor \lifdeltanovar{C_\Gamma},\]
			%the quantifier for $y'_{t+1}$ is in the scope of the quantification of these.
			%Therefore $\lifdelta{t_{i+1}}$ is a valid witness term for the existential quantification of $y'_{t+1}$.
			%$\Gamma \entails \lifdeltanovar{ Q_1 z_{t_1} \dots Q_i z_{t_i} \exists y_{t_{i+1}} \lifpart^*( \LIpre(C), T_{i+1} )} \lor \lifdeltanovar{C_\Gamma}$. 

	\end{itemize}

	By this induction, we obtain that
	$\Gamma \entails \lifdeltanovar{ Q_1 z'_{t_1} \dots Q_n z'_{t_n} \lifpart^*( \LIpre(C), T_n )} \lor \lifdeltanovar{C_\Gamma}$, which is the same as
	$\Gamma \entails \lifdeltanovar{ \LI(C)} \lor \lifdeltanovar{C_\Gamma}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{comment}

	\begin{lemma}
		\label{lemma:successor_li}
		Let $C$ be a clause in a resolution refutation of $\Gamma \cup \Delta$.
		Then for any successor $C'$ of $C$, $\lifgamma{\lifdelta{\LI(C)\tau, Z_\Delta}, Z_\Gamma}$ is contained in $\LI(C')$ for some substitution $\tau$ and sets of terms $Z_\Delta$ and $Z_\Gamma$.
	\end{lemma}
	\begin{proof}
		Let $C_1, \dots, C_n$ be the clauses used in an inference $\inference$ to produce $C$.
		Then clearly $\LI(C_i)\sigma$ occurs in $\LIpre(C)$ for some $i$ such that $1\varleq 1 \varleq n$.
		Moreover, in $\LI(C)$, $\lifgamma{\lifdelta{\LI(C_i)\sigma, Z_\Delta}, Z_\Gamma}$ occurs where $Z_\Gamma$ and $Z_\Delta$ are the sets of maximal colored terms in $\LIpre(C)$ of the respective color which satisfy some lifting condition.
	\end{proof}

	\begin{proof}

		The difference between $\lifdeltanovar{\LIpre(C)}$ and $\lifdeltanovar{\LI(C)}$ lies only in certain maximal colored terms which are lifted and the resulting lifting variable bound in $\lifdeltanovar{\LI(C)}$, hence it suffices to consider these.
		Let $t$ be a colored term in $\LIpre(C)$ at position $p$ such that $\LI(C)\atp = \lifboth{t}$.
		Then $t$ is a maximal colored term. % and contains a variable which does not occur in\nolinebreak{} $C$.

		If $t$ is $\Delta$-colored, then $\lifdeltanovar{\LIpre(C)}\atp = \LI(C)\atp = x_t$.
		Note that as $t$ occurs at $p$ in $\LIpre(C)$, $x_t$ occurs free at $\lifdeltanovar{\LIpre(C)}\atp$.
		The renaming of lifting variables in step \ref{lemma_part_renaming} of the lifting procedure
		ensures that $x_t$ is a fresh lifting variable and hence is not bound by quantifiers introduced for other occurrences of the term $t$, which would otherwise also be lifted by the same lifting variable and bound by the same quantifier\footnote{See Example~\ref{exa:lemma_part_renaming} for an illustration.}.
		Hence by the semantics of free variables, $x_t$ is implicitly universally quantified and therefore entails that an explicit universal quantification in $\LI(C)$ is valid.
		\mytodo{das vllt noch genauer}

		If otherwise $t$ is a $\Gamma$-term, then $\lifdeltanovar{\LIpre(C)}\atp = \lifdeltanovar{t}$.
		Therefore $\lifdeltanovar{t}$ represents a witness term for the existentially quantified lifting variable $y_t$ at $\LI(C)\atp$.
		In general, $\lifdeltanovar{t}$ however contains $\Delta$-lifting variables, hence for $\lifdeltanovar{t}$ to be a valid witness term, these have to be bound such that the existential quantifier of $y_t$ is in their scope.
		Note that occurrences of colored terms which are not maximal colored terms are not lifted in $\LI$.

		Let $x_s$ be a $\Delta$-lifting variable which occurs in $\lifdeltanovar{t}$. 
		Then by Lemma~\ref{lemma:lifting_conditions}, $x_s$ is not bound in $\LIpre(C)$.
	We show that $y_t$ is quantified in the scope of the quantification of $x_s$ by discussing the different possibilities for quantification of~$x_s$:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item
			Suppose that $s$ is lifted in $\LI(C)$ as well.
			Then by the definition of the quantifier prefix, the quantification of $x_s$ precedes the quantification for $x_t$ as $s$ is a subterm of $t$.

		\item
			Suppose that in some successor $C'$ of $C$, a successor $s'$ of $s$ is lifted.
			By Lemma~\ref{lemma:successor_li}, any quantifier of  $\LI(C)$, in particular $\exists y_t$, occurs in $\LI(C')$.
			As $s'$ is lifted in $\LI(C')$, the quantification $\forall x_{s'}$ is present in the quantifier prefix of $\LI(C')$. But then the quantifier for $y_t$ is in the scope of the quantifier of $x_{s'}$.

		\item
			Otherwise there is no successor $C'$ of $C$ such that a successor $s'$ of $s$ is lifted in $\LI(C')$.
			Then it is implicitly universally quantified.
			\qedhere
	\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:gamma_entails_delta_lifted_invariant}
	Let $C$ be a clause in a resolution refutation of $\Gamma \cup \Delta$.
	Then
	$\Gamma \entails \lifdeltanovar{ \LI(C) } \lor \lifdeltanovar{C} $
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We show the strengthening
	$\Gamma \entails \lifdeltanovar{ \LI(C) } \lor \lifdeltanovar{C_\Gamma}$\footnote{Recall that $D_\Phi$ denotes the clause created from the clause $D$ by removing all literals which are not contained $\Lang(\Phi)$.} by induction on the resolution refutation.

	If $C\in \Gamma\cup\Delta$, then Lemma~\ref{lemma:gamma_entails_init} shows that $\Gamma \entails \lifdeltanovar{\PIinit(C)} \lor \lifdeltanovar{C_\Gamma}$, which is the unfolded definition of $\lifdeltanovar{\LIpre(C)} \lor \lifdeltanovar{C_\Gamma}$.
	By Lemma~\ref{lemma:lipre_implies_li}, we immediately get that 
	$\lifdeltanovar{\LI(C)} \lor \lifdeltanovar{C_\Gamma}$.

	For the induction step, suppose the clause $C$ is the result of an inference $\inference$ using the clauses $C_1, \dots, C_n$.
	By induction hypothesis, $\Gamma \entails \lifdeltanovar{\LI(C_i) \lor\nolinebreak (C_i)_\Gamma}$ for $1\varleq i\varleq n$, hence
	by Lemma~\ref{lemma:gamma_entails_step}, we obtain that 
	$\Gamma \entails \lifdeltanovar{\PIstep(\inference, \LI(C_1), \dots, \LI(C_n)) \lor C_\Gamma}$.
	This however is nothing else than $\Gamma \entails \lifdeltanovar{\LIpre(C) \lor C_\Gamma}$.
	Lemma~\ref{lemma:lipre_implies_li} gives the result.
\end{proof}

We now present an example which demonstrates that $\LI$ does produce formulas realizing the idea presented in Example~\ref{exa:one_phase_motivation}.

\begin{exa}
	\label{exa:lemma_part_renaming}
	Let $\Gamma = \{ P(u, v) \lor Q(u) \lor R(v) \}$
	and $\Delta = \{ \lnot P(w, z), \lnot Q(a), \lnot R(a)\}$.
	We consider a resolution refutation of $\Gamma\cup\Delta$ combined with the interpolant extraction.
	In order to emphasize the lifting steps,
	we do not just write $C\mid \LI(C)$ in the derivation as usual for a clause $C$ but $C\mid\LIpre(C)$ above $C\mid \LI(C)$ without a separating line 
	in case $\LIpre(C)$ is different from $\LI(C)$.
	The primed variables make the renaming of lifting variables in step \ref{lemma_part_renaming} of the lifting procedure explicit.
	\begin{prooftree}
		\AxiomCm{ P(u, v) \lor Q(u) \lor R(v) \mid \bot}
		\AxiomCm{ \lnot P(w, z) \mid \top }

		\RightLabelm{\resrule{\resruleres}{w\mapsto u, v\mapsto z}}
		\BinaryInfCm{ Q(u) \lor R(v) \mid P(u, v) }

		\AxiomCm{ \lnot Q(a) \mid \top }

		\RightLabelm{\resrule{\resruleres}{u\mapsto a}}
		\BinaryInfCm{ R(v) \mid Q(a) \lor P(a, v) }
		\noLine
		\UnaryInfCm{ R(v) \mid \forall x_a( Q(x_a) \lor P(x_a, v) ) }

		\AxiomCm{ \lnot R(a) \mid \top }

		\insertBetweenHyps{\hskip -1cm}
		\RightLabelm{\resrule{\resruleres}{v\mapsto a}}
		\BinaryInfCm{ \square \mid R(a) \lor  \forall x_a( Q(x_a) \lor P(x_a, a) ) }
		\noLine
		\UnaryInfCm{ \square \mid \forall x'_a \big( R(x'_a) \lor  \forall x_a( Q(x_a) \lor P(x_a, x'_a) ) \big) }
	\end{prooftree}

	Hence we obtain here a non-prenex interpolant which reflects the logical expressiveness of $\Gamma$, in contrast to 
	the interpolant which is produced by the two phase approach described in chapter~\ref{sec:two_phases}, which in fact is
	$\forall x_a \big( R(x_a) \lor Q(x_a) \lor P(x_a, x_a) \big)$.

	Note that without the renaming of the lifting variables, the result of the extraction would be
	$\forall x_a \big( R(x_a) \lor  \forall x_a( Q(x_a) \lor P(x_a, x_a) ) \big) $.
	In order to emphasize the binding, we alpha-rename this formula to
	$\forall x \big( R(x) \lor  \forall y( Q(y) \lor P(y, y) ) \big) $.
	This is not an interpolant, as this formula is not entailed by $\Gamma$:

	Consider a model $M$ of $\Gamma$ with domain $\domainofmodel{M} = \{0, 1\}$ and an interpretation $\interpretation{M}$ such that
	$\interpretation{M}(R) = \{0\}$,
	$\interpretation{M}(Q) = \emptyset$ and 
	$\interpretation{M}(P) = \{ (0, 1), (1, 1) \}$.
	Then clearly $M \entails P(u, v) \lor Q(y) \lor R(v) $ as depending on the value of $v$, either $R(v)$ or $P(u, v)$ holds.
	But at the same time $M \notentails \forall x \big( R(x) \lor  \forall y( Q(y) \lor P(y, y) ) \big)$ since the instantiation of the bound variables $x$ to $1$ and $y$ to $0$ results in a formula which does not hold in $M$.

\end{exa}


\section{Towards an interpolant}

In a similar fashion as in Lemma~\ref{lemma:symmetry} for $\PI$, we can also show a symmetry-property for $\LI$:

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:li_symmetry}
	Let $\pi$ be a refutation of $\Gamma\cup\Delta$ and $\bhat \pi$ be $\pi$ with $\bhat \Gamma = \Delta$ and $\bhat \Delta = \Gamma$.
	Then for a clause $C$ in $\pi$ and its corresponding clause $\bhat C$ in $\bhat \pi$, $\LI(C) \spas\semiff \lnot \LI(\bhat C)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We proceed by induction to show that $\LIpre(C) \semiff \lnot \LIpre(\bhat C)$:

	If $C \in \Gamma\cup \Delta$, we obtain the result by Lemma~\ref{lemma:symmetry_base}.

	For the induction step, suppose that the clause $C$ is the result of an inference $\inference$ of the clauses $\bar C = C_1, \dots, C_n$.
	Then by the induction hypothesis, $\LI(C_i) \semiff \lnot \LI(\primex C_i)$ for $1 \varleq i \varleq n$. 
	Hence we can apply Lemma~\ref{lemma:symmetry_step} to obtain that $\PIstep(\inference, \LI(C_1), \dots, \LI(C_n)) \semiff \lnot \PIstep(\primex \inference, \LI(\primex C_1), \dots, \LI(\primex C_n))$.
	But this is nothing else than $\LIpre(C) \spas\semiff \lnot \LIpre(\primex C)$.


	We conclude by showing that 
	$\LIpre(C) \semiff \lnot \LIpre(\bhat C)$ 
	implies that 
	$\LI(C) \semiff \lnot \LI(\bhat C)$:
	Clearly the terms to be lifted in $\LIpre(C)$ and $\LIpre(\bhat C)$ are the same and differ only in their color.
	Even though this results in different lifting variables, that is of no relevance as all lifted variables are bound, which makes the formulas alpha-equivalent.
	Additionally, the quantifier type of any given lifting variable in $\Q(C)$ is dual to the respective one in $\Q(\bhat C)$.
	Furthermore note that the subterm-relation is not affected by the coloring, so the ordering of the quantifiers in $\Q(C)$ and $\Q(\bhat C)$ is identical.
	Hence 
	$\LI(C) \semiff \lnot \LI(\bhat C)$.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:delta_entails_li}
	Let $C$ be a clause in a resolution refutation of $\Gamma \cup \Delta$.
	Then
	$\Delta \entails \lnot\lifgammanovar{\LI(C)} \lor \lifgammanovar{C}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Construct $\bhat \pi$ with $\bhat \Gamma = \Delta$ and $\bhat \Delta = \Gamma$. 
	Then by Lemma~\ref{lemma:gamma_entails_delta_lifted_invariant}, $\bhat \Gamma \entails \liftnovar{\bhat \Delta}{\LI(\bhat C)} \lor \liftnovar{\bhat \Delta}{\bhat C}$, 
	which by Lemma~\ref{lemma:li_symmetry} is nothing else than
	$\Delta \entails \lnot \liftnovar{\Gamma}{\LI(C)} \lor \liftnovar{\Gamma}{C}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
	Let $\pi$ be a resolution refutation of $\Gamma \cup \Delta$.
	Then $\LI(\pi)$ is an interpolant for $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	We obtain by Lemma~\ref{lemma:gamma_entails_delta_lifted_invariant} that  $\Gamma \entails \liftnovar{\Delta}{\LI(\pi)}$ and
	by Lemma~\ref{lemma:delta_entails_li} that
	$\Delta \entails \lnot\lifgammanovar{\LI(\pi)}$.
	As the empty clause derived in $\pi$ trivially contains neither variables nor ground terms and as any colored term either contains variables or is ground, at least one lifting condition holds for any maximal colored term in $\LIpre(\pi)$. Hence all colored terms are lifted in $\LI(\pi)$.
	Therefore $\lifdeltanovar{\LI(\pi)} = \LI(\pi)$ and $\lifgammanovar{\LI(\pi)} = \LI(\pi)$.
\end{proof}

We finish this chapter by demonstrating the application of the interpolant extraction procedure $\LI$ on a larger example:

\begin{exa}
	\newcommand{\var}[1]{\ensuremath{v_{#1}}}
	Let $\Gamma = \{R(f(\var{1}, \var{6})), P(f(\var{2}, g(\var{3}, \var{4}))) \lor Q(g(\var{3}, b)), \lnot S(b) \}$
	and $\Delta = \{ S(\var{8}) \lor \lnot P(\var{9}) \lor \lnot R(\var{5}), \lnot Q(g(a, \var{7})) \}$.
	Hence $\Lang(\Gamma) \cap \Lang(\Delta) = \{ R, P, Q, S, g\}$, $\Lang(\Gamma) \setminus \Lang(\Delta) = \{f, b\}$ and $\Lang(\Delta)\setminus\Lang(\Gamma) = \{ a \}$.
	We can produce an interpolant for $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ using the following refutation and extraction in the same notation as Example~\ref{exa:lemma_part_renaming}.
	We emphasize liftings of terms justified by being a ground term not occurring in the clause by \markA{}, and those justified by occurrences of variables which do not occur in the clause by \markB.

			$\markA_1$: The maximal colored term $b$ is lifted as it does not occur in the clause. On the other hand, the maximal colored term $a$ is not lifted since it does occur in the clause.

		$\markB_2$: The maximal colored term $f(v_1, v_6)$ contains the variables $v_1$ and $v_6$, which are not present in the clause.
		Due to the variable-disjointness restriction on clauses, these variables do not occur in any subsequent clause.

		$\markA\markB_3$: Clearly, the term $a$ is a subterm of $f(v_2, g(a, v_4))$, hence we must quantify $x_a$ before $y_{f(v_2, g(a, v_4))}$.

		$\markA_4$: We encounter another occurrence of the maximal colored term $b$ (cf.\ $\markA_1$).
		The lifting conditions however ensure that different lifting variables ($y_b$ and $y'_b$ respectively) are justified.
