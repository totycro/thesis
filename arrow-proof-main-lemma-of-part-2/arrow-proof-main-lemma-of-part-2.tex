\subsection*{noteworthy thoughts}

* seem to not be able to construct $Q(f(h(x)), g(x))$ without arrow between arguments (either merge or a directed one) 

* need some kind of backwards merging

** a possibly useful criterion: $z\sigma$ occurs in $y\sigma$ for $y, z \in C_1 \cup C_2$.

* what about label for arrows containing the variable, which is manipulated by the unifier?

\subsection*{basic facts which should be used in the algorithm}

* variables only occur per clause and are only changed by unification. Hence need to establish conditions at beginning which are not violated by unification.

* without $x \lra f(x)$ situation, no mixed-colored terms can occur

* other unifications transfer mixed-colored terms without producing them.




\section{current version}


\mytodo{finish new version of lemma 1}

\mytodo{show: merge arrow if no grey occurrence lemma in in spe results}

\mytodo{check if old lemma 2 occurs anywhere else}

\mytodo{Fix up major proof below with the new lemmas}


\begin{clemma}
	\label{lemma:arrow_from_grey_to_colored}
	Let $x$ be a variable in $\AIclausede(C)$ occurs in the maximal colored term $t\occ{x}$.
	If it has a grey occurrence in some literal ($\AI(C)$ or or also in literals with colored predicates), then $x\apath t\occ{x}$.
\end{clemma}
\begin{proof}
	Induction start by definition.

	Induction step with usual notation.

	We consider introductions of $t\occ{x}$ by changing the variable $y$.
	Let $\bhat y$ be the position of $y$ which causes the variable to be changed by the unification algorithm.
	$\bhat y$ is in a resolved literal, say $l$, so we denote it by $l\at{\bhat y}$ and its counterpart in $l'$ by $l'\at{\bhat y}$. 

	\begin{description}
		\item[Suppose $x$ occurs grey in $y\sigma$ and a colored $t\occ{y}$ occurs in $C_1$.]
			Then $t\occ{x}$ occurs in $C$ and we have to show that $x\apath t\occ{x}$.

			\begin{itemize}
				\item Suppose $l\at{\bhat y}$ is a grey occurrence.
					Then by the induction hypothesis, $y\apath t\occ{y}$. 
					As $\sigma$ is applied in $C$, $y\sigma\occ{x}\apath t\sigma\occ{x}$.
				\item Suppose $l\at{\bhat y}$ is a colored occurrence and contained in the maximal colored term $s\occ{y}$.

					figure: $Q(\dots t\occ{y} \dots) \lor P(\dots s\occat{y}{p} \dots)\quad\quad \lnot P(\dots s\occat{x}{p})$

					\mytodo{}
					STEPS:

					* either grey $y$ in $C_1$, then have other arrow here

					* otherwise merge arrow -> new lemma?

					* then: show that $l'\occ{\bhat y}$ has arrow, as below.


			\end{itemize}

		\item[Suppose $x$ occurs colored in $y\sigma$ and $y$ occurs in $C_1$ (colored or grey).]
			~

			figure:
			$C_1: Q(\dots \bdot y \dots) \lor l\occat{\bhat y}{p}\quad\quad$
			$C_2: \lnot l\occat{\bhat y'}{p}\quad(\bhat y' \text{ is abstraction of } t\occur{x})$


			\begin{itemize}
				\item Suppose $l'\at{\bhat y}$ contains $x$.
					If $x$ occurs grey in $C_2$, then by the induction hypothesis,
					$x\apath l'\at{\bhat y}$.

					\mbox{Otherwise figure: $ r\occ{y} \lor z \lor l[f(y), g(z)]\quad\; \lnot l[f(h(x)), g(x)]\;\quad z\sigma = x;y\sigma=h(x)$}

					Otherwise $x$ occurs only colored in $C_2$.
					If $x$ does not occur grey in $C$, we are done, so assume it does.
					Then the grey occurrence of $x$ in $C$ is derived from a grey occurrence of a variable $z$ in $C_1$ (such that $x$ occurs grey in $z\sigma$), and $x$ occurs colored in $l'\at{\bhat x}$ and $z$ occurs colored in $l\at{\bhat x}$ (with the same prefix).
					%As $z$ occurs grey in $C_1$ and colored in $l\at{\bhat x}$, $z\apath l\at{\bhat x}$ by the induction hypothesis, which in $C$ applies to $x$. 

					Suppose $y$ occurs grey in $C_1$.
					As $x$ occurs grey in $z\sigma$ and $x$ occurs colored in $y\sigma$, by the backwards merging 1 special case, we have an arrow from $z$ to $y$. Full stop as in $C$, $x\apath y\sigma$.
					%As $y$ occurs grey in $C_1$, by the induction hypothesis, $y\apath l\at{\bhat y}$ and hence $z\apath l\at{\bhat y}$, so in $C$, we have that $x \apath l\at{\bhat y}$.

					Otherwise $y$ occurs colored in $C_1$.
					\mytodo{ we need some connection betwen $r\occ{y}$ and $f(y)$ in $l$}



					\mytodo{ this shows that $x\apath l'\at{\bhat y}$ in any case, it remains to show that it applies to the occurrence $y$ in $C_1$ (in general not in the literal )}



				\item Suppose $l'\at{\bhat y}$ does not contain $x$.
					Then it contains a variable $u$ such that $x$ occurs grey in $u\sigma$. 
					So the situation repeats in $C_2$ as $l'\at{\bhat y}$ is contained in a colored term and $u$ is what $y$ was now.
					Hence we obtain the result by Remark~\substremarkref.

			\end{itemize}

\begin{clemma}
	\largered{deprecated to version above}
	Let $x$ be a variable in $\AIclausede(C)$ which has a grey occurrence and a colored occurrence.
	Then for every colored occurrence $\bhat x$ of $x$, there is an path from a term containing some grey occurrence to a term containing $\bhat x$ using arrows from $\arr(C)$.
	%Also, \circled{2} there is a merge path from every colored occurrence of $x$ to every other colored occurrence of $x$.
\end{clemma}
\begin{proof}
	\newcommand{\one}{\circled{1}}
	\newcommand{\two}{\circled{2}}
	Proof by induction; base case obvious; suppose resolution with usual notation.
	Suppose the paths exist for $C_1$ and $C_2$.

	We consider the different possibilities of introduction of colored occurrences of $x$ and show that in each of them, there is a path from a term containing a grey occurrence to a term containing the colored occurrence.

	\begin{description}
		\item[Suppose $x$ is introduced into a maximal colored term $t$ by means of unification.]
			So $t\sigma$ is a term containing $x$.
			Let $y$ be a variable in $t$ such that $y\sigma$ is a term containing $x$.

			Let $\bhat y$ be the position of $y$ which causes the variable to be changed by the unification algorithm.
			$\bhat y$ is in a resolved literal, say $l$, so we denote it by $l\at{\bhat y}$ and its counterpart in $l'$ by $l'\at{\bhat y}$. 

			\begin{itemize}
				\item Suppose $l\at{\bhat y}$ is a grey occurrence.

					figure: $P(f(y)) \lor Q(\bhat y)\quad\quad\lnot Q(\cdot)$

					Then by the induction hypothesis, there is an path from a term containing some grey occurrence of $y$ to a term containing $y$ in $t$.
					After applying $\sigma$, the path leads from $y\sigma\occ{x}$ to~$t\sigma\occ{x}$.
					If $y\sigma\occ{x}$ has a grey occurrence of $x$, we are done.
					Otherwise it has a colored occurrence of $x$.
					But as $l\at{\bhat y}\sigma = l'\at{\bhat y}\sigma$, there is a colored occurrence of $x$ in $C_2$. 
					If there also is a grey occurrence, then by the induction hypothesis, there is an arrow from some grey occurrence of $x$ to $l'\at{\bhat y}$ and hence there is a path from that grey occurrence to $t\sigma\occ{x}$.
					If there is no grey occurrence of $x$ in $C_2$, suppose that $x$ originates from $C_1$ and there is a grey occurrence of $x$ in $C_1$, as otherwise we are done.
					As $l'\at{\bhat y}\sigma$ contains $x$ but $l\at{\bhat y}\sigma$, $x$ must occur in $l$, say at $\bdot x$ and its corresponding term in $l'$ is a variable, say $z$, such that $z\sigma = x$.
					$z$ also occurs in $l'\at{\bhat y}\sigma$.
					\begin{itemize}
						\item
							Suppose $l\at{\bdot x}$ is a grey occurrence. Then $l'\at{\bdot x}$ is so as well and by the induction hypothesis, there is a path from a term containing a grey occurrence of $z$ in $C_1$ to $l'\at{\bhat y}\sigma$ and we are done.
						\item
							Otherwise $l\at{\bdot x}$ is a colored occurrence.
							Then so is $l'\at{\bdot x}$ and by Lemma~\ref{lemma:arrow_from_all_colored_to_all_colored}, there is a merge edge between a term containing $l'\at{\bdot x}$ and a term containing $l'\at{\bhat y}\sigma$.
							As there is a grey occurrence of $x$ in $C_1$, by the induction hypothesis, there is a path from a term containing a grey occurrence of $x$ to $l'\at{\bdot x}$ and we are done.
					\end{itemize}



				\item Suppose $l\at{\bhat y}$ is contained in a maximal colored term, say $s\occ{y}$.
					\cbstart
					Then in case $t\occ{y} \neq\nolinebreak s\occ{y}$,

					if $y$ occurs grey in $C_1$, since $y\sigma$ 

					by the induction hypothesis, $y\apath s\occ{y}$


					by Lemma~\ref{lemma:arrow_from_all_colored_to_all_colored},
					there is a merge arrow between a term containing $t\occ{y}$ and a term containing $s\occ{y}$.
					\cbend

					As the arrows from terms containing $l\at{\bhat y}$ and the corresponding terms containing $l'\at{\bhat y}$ are merged, we need to show that there is an arrow in the other clause. $l'\at{\bhat y}$ is an abstraction from a term containing $x$.

					\markC
					\begin{itemize}
						\item 
							Suppose $l'\at{\bhat y}$ contains $x$. 

							If there is a grey occurrence of $x$ in $C_2$, we are done as the arrows between $l\at{\bhat y}$ and $l'\at{\bhat y}$ are merged and by the induction hypothesis, $x \apath l'\at{\bhat y}$.

							If there is a grey occurrence of $y$ in $C_1$ and $y\sigma$ contains a grey occurrence of $x$, we are done as by the induction hypothesis, $y \apath t\occ{y}$,
							and after applying $\sigma$, this path leads from a grey occurrence of $x$ to $t\occ{y}\sigma$.

							Otherwise there are no grey occurrences of $x$ and there is nothing to prove.

						\item 
							Suppose $l'\at{\bhat y}$ does not contain $x$.
							Then it contains a variable $v$ such that $v\sigma$ is a term containing $x$.


							As $l'\at{\bhat y}$ is by assumption contained in a colored term, where $x$ is introduced, we know that there is an appropriate arrow by Remark~\substremarkref.


					\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}

		\item [Suppose a term containing $t\occ{x}$ with $t$ colored is in $\ran(\sigma)$.]
			So $y\sigma$ contains $t\occ{x}$ for some $y$, which occurs in w.l.o.g.\ $C_1$.
			Let $\bdot y$ be an arbitrary occurrence of $y$.

			There is an occurrence of $y$ in $l$, say $l\at{\bhat y}$, whose corresponding term $l'\at{\bhat y}$ is an abstraction of $t\occ{x}$. Note that the arrows of $l\at{\bhat y}$ and $l'\at{\bhat y}$ are merged.

			$C_2: \lnot l\occ{\bhat y'}\quad(\bhat y' \text{ is abstraction of } t\occur{x})$

			Now we can argue quite like starting at \markC.
			This establishes that $x \apath l'\at{\bhat y}$ and also $x \apath l\at{\bhat y}$.

			If $y$ and $\bhat y$ are grey occurrences, then by Lemma~\ref{lemma:arrow_from_grey_to_grey}, there is a merge edge and we are done.

			If $\bhat y$ is grey and $\bdot y$ is colored, then by the induction hypothesis, $y \apath \bhat y$ \NB{(which is fine if we order by symbols, not their occurrences)}. 

			If $\bhat y$ is colored and $y$ is grey,
			%and then by the induction hypothesis, there is a path from $y$ to $\bhat y$.
			then by construction of $\arr(C)$, in particular the special treatment of 210g' and as $y\sigma = t\occ{x}$ there is an arrow from any grey occurrence of $x$ to $y$ (if there is one; if there are none, we are done anyway).



			If $\bhat y$ is colored and $y$ is colored, then by Lemma~\ref{lemma:arrow_from_all_colored_to_all_colored}, there is a merge edge between $\bhat y$ and $y$ and we are done.

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:arrow_from_grey_to_grey}
	Let $x$ be a variable in $\AIclausede(C)$.
	Then there is a merge arrow between every pair of distinct grey occurrences of $x$. \comm{possibly not really needed as same var is always lifted by same lifting var, they can never diverge syntactically}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Induction start: by definition.

	Suppose holds for $C_1$ and $C_2$, usual notation.

	Suppose for some grey variable occurrence $x$ that $x\sigma = y$ for some variable $y$ which has a grey occurrence in $C$ (so either it was there in $C_i$ and $y\sigma = y$ or $z\sigma = y$ for some z,  but then some $y$ occurs elsewhere). 

	Then there is a position $\bhat x$ in a resolved literal, say w.l.o.g.\ $l$, such that $l\at{\bhat x} = x$ and $l'\at{\bhat x} = y$.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item
			Suppose that $l\at{\bhat x}$ is a grey occurrence.
			Then so is $l'\at{\bhat x}$.
			By the induction hypothesis, both occurrences have merge edges to all other occurrences of the variable, and these are merged.
			Note that $C_1$ and $C_2$ are variable disjoint, so $x$ does not occur in $C_2$ and $y$ does not occur in $C_1$.

		\item
			Otherwise suppose that $l\at{\bhat x}$ is a colored occurrence.
			Then there are merge edges between all occurrences of $x$ in $C_1$ and $y$ in $C_2$ by construction of the edges, in particular by the special handling of variable renamings.

\section{original proof}

Ideas for simplification:

* Lemma for all cases about what is on the other side

\begin{exa}
	\label{exa:lifting_var_only_abstraction_in_arrow_proof}
	$\Gamma = \{ Q(\gamma(x)) \lor P(x), \lnot Q(\gamma(z)), R(\dots)\}$\todo{$R$ only for coloring}

	$\Delta = \{ \lnot P(\delta(y)) \lor R(y), \lnot R(a), Q(\dots) \}$\todo{$Q$ only for coloring}

	$ a \sim x_k, \delta(y) \sim x_i, \delta(a) \sim x_j $

	\begin{prooftree}
		\AxiomCm{ \bot \mid Q(\gamma(x)) \lor P(x) }
		\AxiomCm{ \top \mid \lnot P(x_i) \lor R(y) }

		\BinaryInfCm{ P(x_i) \mid Q(\gamma(x_i)) \lor R(y) }

		\AxiomCm{ \top \mid \lnot R(x_k) }

		\BinaryInfCm{ (\lnot R(x_k) \land P(x_i) ) \lor (R(x_k) \land \top)  \mid Q(\gamma(x_i)) }
		\noLine
		\UnaryInfCm{ P(x_i) \lor R(x_k)  \mid Q(\gamma(x_i)) }

		\AxiomCm{ \bot \mid \lnot Q(\gamma(z)) }

		\BinaryInfCm{ ( \lnot Q(x_j) \land ( P(x_i) \lor R(x_k) )) \lor (Q(x_j) \land \top)   \mid \square }
		\noLine
		\UnaryInfCm{   \lnot Q(x_j) \land (P(x_i) \lor R(x_k)) \mid \square }

	\end{prooftree}

	Gist: When $Q(\gamma(x_i))$ is the only symbol in $\AI\de(\cdot)$, the lifting var means $\delta(x)$, but in the actual derivation, it's $\delta(a)$. however $\tau$ fixes this.
	So before $Q$ is resolved, there is an arrow, but with the wrong lifting var ($x_i$ instead of $x_j$)
\end{exa}

\begin{remark}[\substremarksym]
	Any substitution, in particular $\sigma$, only changes a finite number of variables.
	Furthermore a result of a run of the unification algorithm is acyclic in the sense that if a substitution $u\mapsto t$ is added to the resulting substitution, it is never the case that at a later stage $t\mapsto u$ is added.
	This can easily be seen by considering that at the point when $u\mapsto t$ is added to the resulting substitution, every occurrence of $u$ is replaced by $t$, so $u$ is not encountered by the algorithm at a later stage.

	Therefore in order to show that a statement holds for every $u\mapsto t$ in a unifier $\sigma$, 
	it suffices to show by an induction argument that for every substitution $v\mapsto s$ which is added to the resulting unifier by the unification algorithm that it holds for $v\mapsto s$ under the assumption that it holds for every $w\mapsto r$ such that $w$ occurs in $s$ and $w\mapsto r$ is added to the resulting substitution at a later stage.
\end{remark}


\begin{conj}
	Let $C$ be a clause in a resolution refutation. 
	Suppose that $\AI\de(C)$ contains a maximal $\Gamma$-term $\gamma_j\occ{z_i}$ which contains a lifting variable $z_i$. %(lifting a $\Delta$-term $\delta_i$).
	%Then there is an arrow in $\arrFinal(C)$ from a term containing $z_k$ in $\AI\de(C)$ such that $\delta_k$ is an abstraction of $\delta_i$ to $\gamma_j\occ{z_i}$.
	Then $z_i \ltArrC z_j$.
\end{conj}
\begin{proof}
	We proceed by induction.
	For the base case, note that no multicolored terms occur in initial clauses, so no lifting term can occur inside of a $\Gamma$-term.

	\newcommand{\oldgam}{\bm\tilde\gamma_{j\bm'}} 
	\newcommand{\newgam}{\gamma_j} % this should correspond with the statement, and there, the symbol should be plain (also below)

	Suppose a clause $C$ is the result of a resolution of $C_1: D \lor l$ and $C_2: E \lor \lnot l$ with $l\sigma = l'\sigma$.
	Furthermore suppose that for every lifting term inside a $\Gamma$-term in the clauses $C_1$ and $C_2$ of the refutation, for every term of the form $\gamma_j\occ{z_i}$ we have that $z_i \ltArrCOne z_j$ or $z_i \ltArrCTwo z_j$ respectively. Hence there is an arrow $(p_1, p_2)$ in $\arrFinal(C_1)$ or $\arrFinal(C_2)$ such that $z_i$ is contained in $\pos(p_1)$ and $z_j$ is contained in $\pos(p_2)$.
	In $\AI\de(C)$, $\pos(p_1)$ contains $\lifboth{z_i\sigma}\tau = z_i\tau$ and $\pos(p_2)$ contains $\lifboth{z_j\sigma}\tau = z_j\tau$.
	Hence the indices of the lifting variables might change, but this renaming does not affect the relation of the objects as $\arrFinal(C_1) \cup \arrFinal(C_2) \subseteq \arrFinal(C)$.


	We show that $z_i \ltArrC z_j $ holds true also for every new term of the form $\newgam\occ{z_i}$ for some $j, i$ in $\AI\de(C)$. By ``new'', we mean terms which are not present in $\AI\de(C_1)$ or $\AI\de(C_2)$.
	Note that new terms in $\AI\de(C)$ are of the form $\lifdelta{t\sigma}\tau$ for some $t \in \AI\de(C_1) \cup \AI\de(C_2)$.
	By Lemma~\ref{lemma:no_lifting_vars_in_subst}, $\sigma$ does not introduce lifting variables.
	Hence a new term of the form $\newgam\occ{z_i}$ is created either by introducing a $\Delta$-term into a $\Gamma$-term or by introducing $\newgam\occ{\delta_i}$ via $\sigma$, both followed by the lifting. 
	Note that $\tau$ only substitutes lifting variables by other lifting variables and hence does not introduce lifting variables. Furthermore by Lemma~\ref{lemma:tau_is_specialisation}, $\tau$ only substitutes lifting variables for other lifting variables, whose corresponding term is more specialised. Hence if there exists an arrow from a lifting variable to $\newgam\occ{z_i}$ according to this lemma, it is also an appropriate arrow if $\newgam\occ{z_i}$ is replaced by $\newgam\occ{z_i}\tau$.


	We now distinguish the two cases under which a new term $\newgam\occ{z_i}$ can occur in $\AI\de(C)$:

	\begin{description}
		\item[Suppose for some $\Gamma$-term $\oldgam\occ{u}$ in $\AI\de(C_1)$ or $\AI\de(C_2)$, $u\sigma$ contains a $\Delta$-term.]\hfill\nopagebreak

			Hence we have that $(\oldgam\occ{u})\sigma = \newgam\occ{\delta_i}$ for some $i$.
			Note that the position of $u$ in $\oldgam\occ{u}$ does not necessarily coincide with the position of $\delta_i$ in $\newgam\occ{\delta_i}$ as $u$ might be substituted by $\sigma$ for a grey term containing $\delta_i$.

			We have that $\lifdeltanovar{\oldgam\occ{u}\sigma}\tau = \newgam\occ{z_i}$.

			\newcommand{\hatu}{{\bm\hat u}}
			\newcommand{\hatuPrime}{t_{\bm\hat u}}
			At some well-defined point of application of the unification algorithm, $u$ is substituted by an abstraction of a term which contains $\delta_i$. This occurrence of $u$ is in $l$ and we denote it by $\hatu$.
			We furthermore denote the term at the corresponding position in $l'$ by~$\hatuPrime$.

			We distinguish cases based on the occurrences of $\hatu$ and $\hatuPrime$.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Suppose $\hatu$ is a grey occurrence.

					\begin{figure}[h]

					\begin{itemize}
						\item $\hatuPrime$ is a term which does not contain a $\Delta$-term.
							Then it contains a variable that is be substituted by $\sigma$ by a term which contains a $\Delta$-term as $u\sigma = \hatuPrime\sigma$ is a term containing a $\Delta$-term.
							We denote by $v$ the variable in $\hatuPrime$ which is substituted by a term containing a $\Delta$-term in case $\hatuPrime$ is a grey term.

							In the course of the unification algorithm, there are further unifications of $v$ since we know that $u\sigma = v\sigma$ is a term containing a $\Delta$-term. 
							Therefore by Remark~\substremarkref, we can assume that there is an appropriate arrow to $\hatuPrime$.

						\item $\hatuPrime$ is a term which contains a $\Delta$-term.
							As $\hatuPrime$ occurs in a $\Gamma$-term in $C_1$, say in $\gamma_m\occ{\hatuPrime}$, $C_1$ contains a multicolored $\Gamma$-term.
							Hence the corresponding term in $\AI\de(C_1)$, is of the form $\gamma_m\occ{z_{i\bm '}}$ for some $i\bm'$. 
							Observe that $i\bm'$ in general is not equal to $i$ as demonstrated in Example~\ref{exa:lifting_var_only_abstraction_in_arrow_proof}, even though we have that $\hatuPrime\sigma = u\sigma$.
							This is because the lifting variables in $\AI(\cdot)$ represent abstractions of the terms in the clauses of the resolution derivation (cf.\ Lemma~\ref{lemma:lifting_var_refers_to_abstraction_of_term}). 
							Therefore we only know by the induction hypothesis that $z_{i\bm'} \ltArrCOne \lifboth{\gamma_m\occ{z_{i\bm'}}} = \lifboth{\hatuPrime}$.

							However by Lemma~\ref{lemma:literals_clauses_equal} and due to the fact that $\hatu$ and $\hatuPrime$ respectively occur in the resolved literal, $\lifdeltanovar{\hatu \sigma}\tau = \lifdeltanovar{\hatuPrime \sigma}\tau$.
							As 
							$\lifdeltanovar{\hatu \sigma}\tau = \lifdeltanovar{\delta_i}\tau = z_i\tau $
							as well as
							$ \lifdeltanovar{\hatuPrime \sigma}\tau = \lifdeltanovar{z_{i\bm'}\sigma}\tau = z_{i\bm'}\tau$,
							we must have that $z_i\tau = z_{i\bm'}\tau$.
							As however $u\sigma = \delta_i$, by the definition of $\aiu$, we have that $\{z_i\mapsto z_i\} \in \tau$, so $z_{i\bm'}\tau = z_i$.

							Since $\tau$ is applied to every literal in $\AI\de(C)$ and in $\AI\de(C_1)$ an arrow from a term containing $z_{i\bm'}$ to $\hatuPrime$ exists,
							the same arrow applied to $\AI\de(C)$ points from a term containing $z_{i\bm'}\tau = z_i$ to $\hatuPrime$.
							Therefore $z_i \ltArrC z_j$.

\section*{something about when i started with connected components}

unification is for resolved literals.

connections between resolved literals and the rest of the clauses is covered by arrows.

if a term enters, merge arrows ensure that everything is propagated.

the special thing about colored occurrences is the fact that they can create multicolored terms in cooperation with grey occurrences..

a variable only occurs in a clause if it was never substituted by anything. Hence in particular all grey occurrences are ``original'' (TODO: renamings of variables)

Let $u$ be a grey occurrence.
let $f(u)$ be a colored occurrence.
either it is original, then we are fine by arrow propagation.
otherwise it has been introduced, but then it has used the network of another variable.

more precisely: %a variable from another clause occurs in a related literal 
a variable $v$ occurs in a related literal in a related position in another clause as $u$ in $f(u)$.
so the variable is substituted by a term containing $u$, say $t\occ{u}$
the arrows at the entry points are merged.

effect: 
$t\occ{u}$ occurs at every grey occurrence of $v$. all arrows mentioning them are merged with the ones mentioning the entry point.
this is justified as the terms there appear ``as they are'', i.e.\ as they are produced at the entry point.

however a colored occurrence cannot be produced from a grey occurrence ($\mgu(x, f(u))$) but only if a grey occ is in the literal and a colored occ is elsewhere in the clause (the network of the other var). but then there are (directed) arrows.


Every variable has a connected network in a clause. 

there is a barrier between colored terms.

\section{results in spe}

\begin{clemma}
	there is a merge edge between all occurrences of a variable $x$ in all colored terms of the same ``stage'' (and directed arrows between stages).
\end{clemma}
\begin{proof}
	a stage means the color alternation level: only $\Gamma$, $1 \Gamma + 1 \Delta$, and so on.

	more formally: on the prefix to $x$ in a maximal colored term $t$, iterate in order and increase counter whenever the current symbol has a different color than the previously encountered color. the counter is increased for the first colored symbol. this number plus the color of $t$ define the stage.

	induction start: by def.

	induction step, usual notation.

	Suppose a term $t\occ{y}$ changes its stage. 
	So it contains a variable $y$ h

	\label{lemma:arrow_from_one_color_to_other_color}
	If a variable $x$ occurs in a maximal colored term $s\occ{x}$ which is a $\Gamma$-term as well as in a maximal colored term $t\occ{x}$ which is a $\Delta$-term in $C$, then $x\apath s\occ{x}$ and $x\apath t\occ{x}$.
\end{clemma}
\begin{proof}
	This situation does not occur in the induction start.

	Induction step, usual notation.

	We consider resolution steps which create this situation. 
	Clauses are variable disjoint, so if a variable occurs in a term of a color, it can only also occur in a term of another color by entering the other term via unification.

	}
	Let $x$ be a variable in $\AIclause\de(C)$ which has a grey occurrence and a colored occurrence. 
	Then there is an arrow in $\arr(C)$ from a term containing a grey occurrence to a term containing a colored occurrence.
	%Suppose there is a colored and a grey occurrence of $x$.
	%Then for every colored occurrence $p$ of $x$ there is an arrow from some grey occurrence to~$p$ in \mytodo{}.
	\comm{Should also hold for all of $\AI\de$, but is currently not needed in the proof}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	For clauses $C$ in the initial clause set, $\arr(C)$ is defined to contain an arrow from every grey occurrence to every colored occurrence for every variable occurring in the clause.  

	For the induction step, suppose the lemma holds for $C_1$ and $C_2$. 
	Note that $C_1$ and $C_2$ are variable disjoint.
	\mytodo{how to continue without checking every single case?}

	Note that terms are only changed by means of substitution. 

	If a variable is substituted, it does not occur any further in the derivation. 

	If a variable is substituted by a term containing variables, this is fine because the original arrows still apply for the new terms.
